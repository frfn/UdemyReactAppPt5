Setting up took almost 20-25 min since I had created app from npx create-react-app
 - Files all came from Udemy
 - Copied over the /src files and npm install
 - Created a GitHub so I can push changes and store them
 - Works as expected, first glance, 4 main files with Blog.js being the main file where all the components will go
 - NewPost.js is stateful while all our stateless (changed)
 - They are all class based components since we will be using lifecycle methods, we can use React Hooks here as well
 
1. Starting the AJAX / HTTP requests
     - We can use the built in XML / HTTP request methods but that will be cumbersome, we will use a third party library called Axios:
         - Axios
             - I can add to any React Application, it is JavaScript and used for XMLHTTPRequests
             - npm install axios --save
             - import axios 

         - Axios is Promise based
             - it will have something to report back to you
             - 3 states
                 - pending
                 - fulfilled
                 - rejected      
             - This means that the whole web page can load and does not need to wait for the process to finish, Axios is ASYNC + Promise based
             - Synchronous VS Asynchronous:
                 - Sync is one process at a given time
                 - Aysnc is multiple processes at a given time 

     - Storing the request from axios into a variable DOES NOT work
         - .get() is async, it does not finish immediately, it needs time to go to the server and collect data

         - to store it, use the state!
            - setState({
                posts: response.data
            })

     - Manipulate data!
         - Since response.data is an array, we can use methods on it and shorten it, map it, reduce, etc! 

         - In Blog.js, we have shortened it (using splice() method) and added an author property with the help of the spread operator ( ...post ) and .map()

         - Working with async methods should be thought of ahead of time, here I faced a problem where I am getting an error from FullPost.js
             - Network Loop

2. Getting familiar with data
     - axios.get('url').then( ..code ..)
         - this will return a JSON formatted data from the URL, in the example, the server we're pinging is RESTful. So it returns a JSON formatted data


     - axios.post('url', {obj})
         - we are sending an object to the server, and POSTing it

3. NewPost.js
     - I got ahead of myself and created something that would be nice if there were multiple forms. Using dynamic object naming notation, in setState, setting the values

     - I am getting over my head tbh, stay focused, and don't worry about 'remembering' all the things. No one knows everything. Stay motivated! Okay? :)

     - axios
         - I am using axios.post(url, obj, config) which takes in three arguments!
         - look at NewPost.js to see how it works


     - axios(url).then(response => { ..code.. })

     EXTRA:
         - added a 'Loading...' in the button component
         - was wondering how I can have text while the POST process happening,

4. deletePostHandler method
     - axios.delete(URL)
     - I took a look at how .delete() works, it is the URL that you need to delete the item
     - it is async/promise based SO it will return a response object

5. Blog.js
     - .catch() has been implemented and it is to catch if there are errors that occurs
     - created a property in state, error: false
     - set error to true in .catch() so that it indicates that there is an error that occured
     - changed the String for 'posts' so that it can display 'Oops, something went wrong...'
     - Done with an if statement, if ( !this.state.error ) { ..show posts.. } 

6. Interceptors â€“ so we can execute code gloablly (example, when a request from axios is sent)
     - I go to the most global file, index.js
     - index.js is what is mounted to the DOM
     - import axios from 'axios'
     - if I intercept, it will BLOCK the current request for Blog.js
         - to fix, return the requestConfig object!
     - The idea behind interceptors is that I can edit request configs
         - I can add headers, stuff like that
         - Powerful because we can add authorization headers as well
     - the second argument is for errors
     - you can add or remove by 
     axios.interceptors.request/response.use/eject(requestConfig/responseConfig => { .. code ..})
    
7. Setting default settings
     - Ease of use: instead of writing the URL every time, I can configure a setting
         - axios.defaults.baseURL = 'url'
     - Accessing headers and adding/modifying/deleting values in the property

8. Creating and Using Axios Instances
     - created a new file, axios.js
     - This is a copy of the axios object
     - commented out axios baseURL and common['Auth'] and put it in axios.js
         - Creating a new instance!
     - export default instance; -- its like exporting class or functional components
     - don't forget to change all of the classes that use Axios to use the newly created instance!
     - Note: I do not see the interceptors console log anymore (the request and response) because the setter was set up for the GLOBAL axios object

9. ROUTING
    - Enables SPA properties
        - Multiple pages in a single page
        - One server, multiple pages, it is done by routing
    - Prep
        - Blog.js
            - created a header --> nav --> ul --> li, a href="/" | href="/new-posts"
            - created a CSS for the ul, li, a tags 
    - Setting Up
        - npm install --save react-router react-router-dom
            - MUST have both dependencies react-router AND react-router-dom
            - --save so it SAVES in the package.json 
        - router is NOT by Facebook
    - Start
        - comment out FullPost and NewPost
        - "/" is root path
        - "/new-post" is new post path, etc.
        - In Index or App, you MUST wrap part of the app that should render routes
            - Did in App.js
            - <BrowserRouter> enables routing!
                - Wraps <Blog /> so any component in Blog will get the logic for Routing
        - Created new folder in Blog folder, Posts
        - Moved NewPost and FullPost inside container/Blog because these are now DISTINCT pages because of routing
    - React Router vs React Router Dom
        - historically React Router is what you'd need, but React Router Dom is ultimately the dependency you need
    - Moved all the Post logic, state and code into Posts.js
        - Moved entirety of code from Blog.js to Posts.js, including the componentDidMount
        - removed the selectedPostId and error property in the state!
            - not needed because it was used in the Blog.js
    - Blog.js is just a skeleton now, a framework for the components to be in
        - Reformatted the Blog.js, modularized is all I did
